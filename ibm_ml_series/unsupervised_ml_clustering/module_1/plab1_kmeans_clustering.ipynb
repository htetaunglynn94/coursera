By (legally) gathering information about you and your purchasing habits, corporations are able to group you with other customers that have similar characteristics. K Means clustering is one such algorithm that can categorize similar people! Then, companies can determine this population's potential preferences and personalize your experience with the brand, which ranges from product recommendations to email marketing content. \n\nIn this notebook, you will learn the fundamentals of how to accomplish grouping with K Means and use it for segmenting mall customers and images.\n\n<img src=\"https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-ML0187EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/module%203/images/online-shopping.jpg\" style=\"width: 60%\">\n",

For example, customers can be divided based on age, gender, income, marital status, and others. Segmenting customers in this way can have several applications for a business. For instance, common characteristics of the most profitable customers can be identified and a tailored marketing strategy can be implemented to target them.\n\nLet's have a go at customer segmentation using the K Means Clustering algorithm.\n",
