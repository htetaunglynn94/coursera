You'll probably see many many words that appear in almost all documents, such as `the`, `and`, and `so`. If you wanted to quickly analyze text to find the most important words in documents, just looking at word counts isn't good enough. Those previous words would dominate the term frequency in volume and clutter our analysis.\n","\n","By performing tf-idf, we can reduce the value assigned to these words that are really common in all our documents, and increase the value of words that may appear a lot in a certain document, but not frequently in other documents.\n","\n","### Applications\n","\n","WIth a tf-idf matrix, you can succintly capture important textual information from a large group of text documents. **A corpus is defined as a large structured set of text**. It gives you an efficient representation of what the important words are to each document, and potentially how the words can relate documents together.\n","\n","**We will be using tf-idf matrices in the next lab!**\n","\n","## What is tf-idf?\n","\n","A tf-idf matrix is a `term frequency - inverse document frequency` matrix. Every row within this matrix will represent a document, and every column represents a term (a term could be a single word or an n-tuple of words such as *United States of America*). A tf-idf matrix is actually an augmented `term frequency`, `bag of words` or `document-term` matrix.\n","\n","### What is `term frequency`?\n","\n","A `term frequency` matrix simply counts the number of occurences of a given word within a document.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"QQvFQNSAq8Ze"},"source":["## Objectives\n","\n","After completing this lab you will be able to:\n","\n","*   Understand what term frequency and tf-idf matrices are\n","*   Explain the intuition behind both matrices and how they are calculated\n","*   Apply tf-idf to a corpus of text and find the most important word in each document\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"f_fu-ZVsq8Ze"},"source":["***\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Q_LKBqoDq8Zf"},"source":["## Setup\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"zE4VyKWMq8Zf"},"source":["For this lab, we will be using the following libraries:\n","\n","*   [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMML0187ENSkillsNetwork31430127-2021-01-01) for managing the data.\n","*   [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMML0187ENSkillsNetwork31430127-2021-01-01) for mathematical operations.\n","*   [`sklearn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMML0187ENSkillsNetwork31430127-2021-01-01) for machine learning and machine-learning-pipeline related functions.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"9j3ro2XOq8Zf"},"source":["### Installing Required Libraries\n","\n","The following required libraries are pre-installed in the Skills Network Labs environment.
